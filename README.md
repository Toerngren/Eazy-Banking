Depending on PC/MAC: 
When loading the preloaded data from our json files you **MIGHT** have to change the file path on six methods.
The methods are called "jsonFrom" and "jsonTo". The **6** methods are located at the very bottom of "Menu.java" class.
Depending on if you are on a PC or a Mac you might have to **remove** or **add** this: 


"dit094_miniproject_group_3" +System.getProperty("file.separator") + 
**Or**
"dit094_miniproject_group_3" +System.getProperty("file.separator") + "src" + System.getProperty("file.separator") + 
If you need to add it you simply add it before:

"src" + System.getProperty("file.separator") + "controller" + System.getProperty("file.separator") + "Customer.json"), Customer[].class);

in each of the six methods.


To login as an Employee you can use:
username: admin
password: admin

To login as a Customer with access to all banking services you can use:
personal number: 6410124540
password: chokladpralin

There are also more customers loaded from the json file.
